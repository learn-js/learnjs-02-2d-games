## About the book

Many javascript game / animation library I've found bundle things like requestAnimationFrame polyfill, gameloop, entities, abstract drawing methods, keyboard/mouse input, vector math, and more into one entangled library. If I don't like how the library handles just one of those components, I'm stuck with dead library weight, and sometimes it's difficult to replace a library's methods.

Let's break down these components into separate pieces, learn what's available already on npm that we can use to build 2d games, and experiment with different approaches to building javascript games.

Let's use the node.js module system and code patterns to build small, reusable game modules and use them to make fun 2d games.

### The reader
The ideal reader for this book is someone who likes exploring, imagining, and inventing for themselves. You probably have some experience with javascript already, and you'd like to learn more about animation using the canvas tag, basic game development patterns, and gain intermediate skills in developing javascript modules that can be used on the server and in the browser.

### Goals of the book
You'll learn:  
- Basic game development fundamentals.
- The use of js modules from npm for creating interactive content.
- How to use the HTML5 canvas tag for animation and user interaction.
- Using javascript to manipulate html elements.
- Using javascript for server-side coding.
- Intermediate node.js module creation and best practices.
- Using developer tools like Git, GitHub, Chrome Dev Tools, Bower, npm, and Grunt.
